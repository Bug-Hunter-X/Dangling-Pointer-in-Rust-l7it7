This repository demonstrates a common error in Rust involving dangling pointers. The `bug.rs` file contains code that creates a dangling pointer, leading to undefined behavior.  The `bugSolution.rs` file shows how to avoid this error using safe Rust practices, specifically by avoiding raw pointers whenever possible and ensuring that data is properly managed.
